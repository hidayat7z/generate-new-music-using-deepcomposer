use pre-trained models to generate new music on AWS DeepComposer

AWS Deep Composer uses Generative AI, or specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate music. GANs pit 2 networks, a generator and a discriminator, against each other to generate new content.

AWS DeepComposer Workflow

 -   Use the AWS DeepComposer keyboard or play the virtual keyboard in the AWS DeepComposer console to input a melody.
 -   Use a model in the AWS DeepComposer console to generate an original musical composition. You can choose from jazz, rock, pop, symphony or Jonathan Coulton pre-trained models or you can also build your own custom genre model in Amazon SageMaker.
 -   Publish your tracks to SoundCloud or export MIDI files to your favorite Digital Audio Workstation (like Garage Band) and get even more creative.

Generative AI

Generative AI is one of the biggest recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology because of its ability to create something new. It opens the door to an entire world of possibilities for human and computer creativity, with practical applications emerging across industries, from turning sketches into images for accelerated product development, to improving computer-aided design of complex objects. It takes two neural networks against each other to produce new and original digital works based on sample inputs.
